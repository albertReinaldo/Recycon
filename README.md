## Recycon

Recycon is a newly website that sells recycle and secondhand things like accessories, houseware, and others. In this website, customer can buy many goods and also doing payment. While the admins can manage the item/product that will be sold to the customer. I was asked to create a website for this online shop using Laravel 8. There are three types of userâ€™s role in this website: Admin, Customer, and Guest (non-logged-in user). There will always have navigation bar and footer in every page . This project was created to fulfill graduation in the web programming laboratory class.
